Thus far our group work has been pretty laid. We collaborate together via Discord to discuss issues that we are having and when tasks are being completed. 
Main points of discussion have been how to break the classes up, how we want to develope the project and when we are availabe to work on the deliverables given to us.
When it comes to how we divide up the work, we come together on Discord and work on the deliverables there. We do most communication through text, but have also done some 
communication through voice calls. Once we begin on the project, we will be more organized. However for right now, we feel our current way of doing our tasks is fine. 
Each deliverable is listed within it's appropriate folder. Example: Deliverable 1 will be found in folder "Deliverable_1". This Readme will also be included in its 
appropriate folder. 

Deliverables:

Deliverable #1 (10%) - Prepare the template of each class. Use Doxigen Comments for future
easy documentation preparation.

Deliverable #2 (15%) - Create a new Class Diagram with the fully annotated operations
required to carry out the use cases in the system function statement. Print a copy of the new
Class Diagram and insert it into the documentation folder.

Deliverable #3 (25%) – Create all the Use Case Diagrams in UML required for your project
and all the scripts associated with those Diagrams (follow the style of the example of the
book). Add them the documentation folder (i.e. SRS file). You may want to list them in
Appendix if the addition makes the documentation to bulky

Deliverable #4 (10%) - Create an augmented class diagram that shows the inheritance
structure, newly discovered classes and relationships, and cloud compartments showing
important properties of the classes.

Deliverable #5 (10%) – Updated class diagram with the specifications for the new
classes and relationship discovered.

Deliverable #6 (10%) - Update the code for your classes by adding the attributes you
have discovered and by creating the newly discovered classes. Perform any additional
modification that you have discovered so far.

Deliverable #7 (10%) - Required Readme file - Prepare a small “Readme” file in which
you discuss your experience in the group so far. Include any alternative decisions that
you had to make, or issues that you faced, or domain analysis decisions that changed over
time. Also indicate how the work has been distributed in the group and how the
teamwork has been organized. If changes have occurred over time indicate the data of the
change. The ReadMe file should also guide the instructor through the final folder report
that contains all the deliverables by providing and index (for example, the list of the
folder and what each folder contain) and indicate any information that may be necessary
to communicate to the instructor while reading the final report of the deliverables. Add
any information generated in the template report that has been given to you in the part 1
of the project

Deliverable #8 (10%) – Print the documentation developed in this part of the project by
running Doxigen in the folder with all the C++ classes generated. Use the html file
produced by the application, print it and attach it to your report.
